# Keylogger_project
Project that aims to show the vulnerability of data snatching from pop up windows
using technologies like Duckyscript language and powershell programming.
Once the BadUSB is connected to the computer the script downloads and opens the
script from github link and executes it.
Upon executing it, a pop up window is opened that directs user to input username and password.
The data is then stored within the text document that is ready to be exported.
